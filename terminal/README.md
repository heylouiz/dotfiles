# Terminal settings

![Terminal preview](images/preview.png?raw=true "Terminal Preview")

I use Gnome Terminal and since there's no easy way to version control it's config files I found this script [gnome-terminal-profile](https://github.com/yktoo/yktools/blob/master/gnome-terminal-profile) that can import/export the default profile.

On folder **colors** there's a screenshot of my configuration and a XResource file to configure urxvt with this colorscheme.

The colorscheme is based on [Vim papercolor-theme](https://github.com/NLKNguyen/papercolor-theme).

To import the terminal configuration to your Gnome terminal:
```gnome-terminal-profile import Papercolor```

Where Papercolor is the name of my exported profile

I'm using the [Hack](https://github.com/source-foundry/Hack) font with size 8.
